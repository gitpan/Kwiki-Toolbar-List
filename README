NAME
    Kwiki::Toolbar::List - Creates an unordered list for the toolbar items
    in a Kwiki site.

SYNOPSIS
         $ cpan Kwiki::Toolbar::List
         $ cd /path/to/kwiki
         $ echo "Kwiki::Toolbar::List" >> plugins
         $ kwiki -update

DESCRIPTION
    Kwiki::Toolbar::List displays the toolbar items as a pipe delimited
    string which looks great but is difficult to apply a style sheet to.
    This module displays the toolbar as an unordered list that can be styled
    easily. It also provides more control from a template, so if you don't
    like an unordered list, you can simply change the HTML in the template
    instead of modifying a Perl module.

    This module should be used in place of Kwiki::Toolbar.

    Another module, Kwiki::Theme::TabNav provides an example of the styling
    that can be applied to the toolbar.
